This repository explains the requirement analysis phase of the SDLC, focusing on how to identify, document, and validate software requirements. It includes examples, diagrams, and documentation to guide developers in building clear and effective project foundations

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of gathering, analyzing, documenting, and validating the requirements of a software project. It ensures that developers and stakeholders have a clear, shared understanding of the system’s expected behavior and constraints.
During this phase, software engineers interact with clients, end-users, and other stakeholders to determine:
- Functional Requirements: What the system should do (features, inputs, outputs, and interactions).
- Non-Functional Requirements: How the system should perform (security, speed, usability, reliability, etc.).


## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- Foundation for Design and Development:
A well-defined set of requirements guides developers and designers in building the right product.
- Prevents Costly Errors:
Identifying unclear or conflicting requirements early helps avoid expensive changes later in development.
- Improves Communication:
Creates a common understanding between clients, developers, and project managers, minimizing misunderstandings.
- Ensures Quality and User Satisfaction:
The software meets user expectations when requirements are correctly captured and validated.
- Supports Project Planning:
Clear requirements help estimate project timelines, resources, and budgets accurately.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
1. Requirement Gathering: Collecting all possible requirements from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, or observation.
2. Requirement Elicitation: Clarifying and refining gathered information to identify true needs.
3. Requirement Specification: Documenting the requirements in a clear and structured form, often in a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document.
4. Requirement Validation: Reviewing and confirming that the documented requirements align with user expectations and project goals.
5. Requirement Management: Tracking and updating requirements as the project evolves to handle changes effectively.

## Types of Requirements.
### Functional Requirements
These define what the system should do (the core actions and features of the booking platform).
- User Registration & Login: Users can create accounts and securely log in.
- Property Search & Filter: Users can search for hotels by location, price, or amenities.
- Booking & Payment: Users can book rooms and complete payments through integrated gateways.
- Review & Rating System: Guests can leave feedback after their stay.
- Host Management: Property owners can list, edit, and manage their accommodations.

### Non-functional Requirements
These define how the system should perform (focusing on quality, performance, and reliability).
- Performance: Pages should load within 2 seconds for a smooth user experience.
- Security: Data encryption for all transactions and user credentials.
- Availability: The system should maintain 99.9% uptime.
- Scalability: Able to handle increasing numbers of users and bookings.
- Usability: The interface should be intuitive and mobile-friendly.

## Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams are visual representations that show how users (actors) interact with a system to achieve specific goals. They illustrate the system’s functional requirements from the user’s perspective.

### Benefits
- Provide a clear overview of system functionality.
- Help identify user roles and their interactions.
- Improve communication between developers and stakeholders.
- Serve as a foundation for writing detailed use case specifications.

## Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria define the conditions that must be met for a feature to be considered complete and acceptable by the client or user. They ensure that requirements are clear, testable, and aligned with user expectations, reducing misunderstandings and rework.

### Example – Checkout Feature:
- The user can review booking details before payment.
- The system supports multiple payment methods (e.g., card, PayPal).
- A confirmation message and booking ID are displayed after successful payment.
- The user receives a confirmation email within one minute of checkout.
