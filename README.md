# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository explains the requirement analysis phase of the SDLC, focusing on how to identify, document, and validate software requirements. It includes examples, diagrams, and documentation to guide developers in building clear and effective project foundations

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of gathering, analyzing, documenting, and validating the requirements of a software project. It ensures that developers and stakeholders have a clear, shared understanding of the systemâ€™s expected behavior and constraints.
During this phase, software engineers interact with clients, end-users, and other stakeholders to determine:
- Functional Requirements: What the system should do (features, inputs, outputs, and interactions).
- Non-Functional Requirements: How the system should perform (security, speed, usability, reliability, etc.).
